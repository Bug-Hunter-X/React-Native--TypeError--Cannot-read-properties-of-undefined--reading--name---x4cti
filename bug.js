This error occurs when you try to access a property of an object that is null or undefined.  This is common in React Native when dealing with asynchronous data fetching. For example, if you are rendering a component that relies on data from an API call, and the API call hasn't completed yet, the data might be null or undefined, leading to this error. Consider this example:

```javascript
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      data: null,
    };
  }

  componentDidMount() {
    fetch('https://api.example.com/data')
      .then(response => response.json())
      .then(data => this.setState({ data }));
  }

  render() {
    return (
      <View>
        <Text>{this.state.data.name}</Text> {/* Error here if data is null */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

If the API call hasn't finished, `this.state.data` will be null, and attempting to access `this.state.data.name` throws the error.
